# This script runs the end-to-end tests against eventing-contrib built
# from source.

# If you already have the *_OVERRIDE environment variables set, call
# this script with the --run-tests arguments and it will use the cluster
# and run the tests.
# Note that local clusters often do not have the resources to run 12 parallel
# tests (the default) as the tests each tend to create their own namespaces and
# dispatchers.  For example, a local Docker cluster with 4 CPUs and 8 GB RAM will
# probably be able to handle 6 at maximum.  Be sure to adequately set the
# MAX_PARALLEL_TESTS variable before running this script, with the caveat that
# lowering it too much might make the tests run over the timeout that
# the go_test_e2e commands are using below.

# Calling this script without arguments will create a new cluster in
# project $PROJECT_ID, start Knative eventing system, install resources
# in eventing-contrib, run all of the test suites and delete the cluster.

# Variables supported by this script:
#   PROJECT_ID:  the GKR project in which to create the new cluster (unless using "--run-tests")
#   MAX_PARALLEL_TESTS:  The maximum number of go tests to run in parallel (via "-test.parallel", default 12)
